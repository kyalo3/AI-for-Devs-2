# Polling app scaffold (alx-polly)

This file describes the scaffold added to bootstrap authentication and polling features.

Files added

- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` — placeholder sign-in page (client). Wire to NextAuth/Clerk/email etc.
- `app/auth/register/page.tsx` — placeholder register page (client).
- `app/polls/page.tsx` — polls index (server component). Lists mock polls.
- `app/polls/create/page.tsx` — create poll form (client placeholder).
- `app/polls/[id]/page.tsx` — poll detail view (server component placeholder).
- `components/ui/button.tsx` — lightweight Button wrapper compatible with shadcn API.
- `components/ui/input.tsx` — simple Input wrapper.
- `components/ui/card.tsx` — simple Card wrapper.
- `components/poll/PollCard.tsx` — poll list item using Card + Button.

Next steps

1. Install and configure the shadcn/ui components if you want the official styling and components. Once installed, replace the small wrappers in `components/ui/*` with imports from `@/components/ui` generated by shadcn tools.
2. Add API routes or a backend to create/fetch polls. Example endpoints: `GET /api/polls`, `GET /api/polls/:id`, `POST /api/polls`.
3. Wire authentication (NextAuth, Clerk, or your provider) and protect routes that require a user.
4. Add validation, tests, and a design system tokens file if needed.

Notes

- The wrappers are intentionally minimal so the app can render even if shadcn isn't installed yet. They are compatible with shadcn's prop names so switching later should be straightforward.
