Capstone Project: Build with AI Intentionally
Welcome to your final challenge! This capstone project is your opportunity to apply everything you’ve learned about AI-assisted development, schema-aware coding, automated reviews, and in-IDE tooling.

🧠 What to Expect
Over the next few days, you’ll move from planning to execution, with AI tools supporting each stage of the process.

You’ll:

✅ Design your own project and tech stack
✅ Plan how AI will support your work — from code generation to testing
✅ Use tools like Trae, Cursor, or CodeRabbit to review your work and speed up delivery
✅ Practice writing better prompts and documenting with purpose
✅ Push your work with thoughtful commits, AI summaries, and real documentation

This isn’t about showing what AI can do for you. It’s about showing how you can collaborate with AI to build something meaningful—efficiently, creatively, and responsibly.

📌 Capstone Structure
📍 Planning
Define your project scope
Choose your stack
Plan your use of AI for:
Feature generation
Testing
Schema or API-aware development
Deliverable: A README.md with your project plan
🚀 Build & Review
Start building using your AI-enhanced IDE
Use reviews, doc generation, and commit helpers
Finalize your app with tests and a complete README
Deliverables: Working repo, reflection file
🌟 Showcase

Record a walkthrough or share a written explanation
Submit your repo and documentation
🧩 Project Ideas
You can build any project of your choice. Here are some ideas: - RESTful API with authentication
- Polling or voting system
- Personal dashboard or task manager
- Blog with markdown support
- Weather or finance tracker

Or… Extend the Next.js Polling App
If you enjoyed working on the next.js polling app , feel free to improve it and add new features. Here are a few suggestions:

🔒 Add user role management (e.g., admin vs. regular users)
📊 Add poll result charts (using a charting library)
💬 Add comments or discussion threads on each poll
📱 Make it mobile-responsive and improve accessibility
📦 Integrate an email notification system (e.g., poll closing alerts)
🧪 Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library
🧠 Apply AI-powered reviews and use CodeRabbit to generate release notes
📷 Generate QR codes for individual polls to make them easily shareable across devices
Use AI smartly. Prompt with context. Document with care. Push with intention.

Let’s build.
